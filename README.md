# Sales Forecasting and Visualization for E-commerce using ARIMA

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a real-time forecasting and visualization system for an e-commerce platform. It uses the ARIMA model for sales predictions and provides an interactive Flask-based dashboard to monitor performance metrics and gain actionable insights.

**Key Features**
* Time Series Analysis: Seasonal trends and patterns in e-commerce sales are analyzed.
* ARIMA Forecasting: Robust prediction of daily revenue trends.
* Real-time Dashboard: An interactive Flask application for dynamic visualizations and API-based predictions.
* Performance Metrics: Visualization of model performance with actual vs. predicted revenue.

**Project Files**
* app.py: Flask application for real-time forecasting and performance visualization.
* data.csv: Cleaned e-commerce transactional data for time series analysis.
* index.html: Front-end for the Flask dashboard, styled for user-friendly interaction.
* Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model validation.
* Final report.docx: Detailed documentation of the project's scope, implementation, and results.

**Tools and Technologies**
* Programming Languages: Python, HTML, CSS
* Libraries: Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels
* Visualization Tools: Matplotlib for time series plots
* Web Framework: Flask for backend integration and dashboard development

**Usage**
**Dashboard Features**
1) Forecasting: Enter the number of days to predict future sales and view the results dynamically.
2) Performance Metrics: Visualize actual vs. fitted revenue trends using an interactive chart.

**Key Results**
* The ARIMA model accurately captured seasonal trends, providing actionable insights for decision-making.
* The real-time dashboard enabled stakeholders to query predictions dynamically with reduced computation time.
